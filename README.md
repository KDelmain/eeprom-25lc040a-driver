# EEPROM 25LC040A Driver

A modern C++17 driver for the **Microchip 25LC040A**, a 4Kbit SPI EEPROM memory chip.  
This driver provides read/write access and is designed for use in bare-metal embedded systems, cross-platform host testing, or HAL abstraction layers.

It is portable, testable, and interface-based, making it easy to integrate with STM32, AVR, or any other microcontroller with SPI support.
